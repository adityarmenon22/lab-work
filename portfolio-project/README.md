# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my first HTML portfolio website created for Lab Assignment 1 as part of my BTech CSE first-year Web Development course.

## Features

- One-page responsive design using basic HTML and CSS only
- Semantic HTML structure with `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`
- About Me section with a profile photo and short intro
- Projects section listing mini-projects Iâ€™ve done in Python and web development
- Skills section displayed in a table format
- Contact form (non-functional demo)
- Clean, simple, and beginner-friendly styling

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the portfolio.
2. You can customize the About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact sections as you learn more HTML and CSS.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practiced using HTML5 semantic elements
- Built and styled a simple one-page web project
- Applied table, list, form elements, and internal links for navigation
